"""Registration, sign-in, sign-out, and the current-member lookup.

Authentication is required system functionality, but it is deliberately NOT
counted as one of the project's main Lost & Found features (spec section 4).

Confirming the emailed code is a hard gate. Registering creates the account and
mails a code, but issues no session at all; the browser only gets the pending
cookie, which can do nothing except confirm or ask for another code. The session
is issued at the moment the correct code is entered — that one step is what both
finishes registration and signs the member in.
